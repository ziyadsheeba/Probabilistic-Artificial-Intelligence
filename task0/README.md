# Task Description
The aim of this task is to identify the probability distribution the dataset was drawn from. A prior on the distributions is given, where with a probability 25% the data vector was drawn from a gaussian distribution, 35% from a laplacian distribution and 40% from a student-t distribution. The variables xi (the components of the data vector) are assumed to be independent and identically distributed.

# Solution Approach
The posterior of each distribution was calculated using Bayes' Rule in an effecient manner. For the hand written derivation check the task0_sol.pdf file.
